            "description": "The Standard is a compact, fast ground robot that fires 17mm pellets at a high rate, dealing and receiving the majority of damage in matches. In our design, we've incorporated a gyroscope to enable the robot's chassis to rotate while maintaining a stable, aiming gimbal. This mechanism reduces the likelihood of hits to our armor, preserving our health count.",
